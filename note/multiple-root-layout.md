### Route Group

- A route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in parenthesis: `(folderName)`.
- In a route group, you can use `layout.js` inside or outside the parentheses.

### Creating Multiple Root Layouts and Their Benefits

- **Creating Multiple Root Layouts**:

  - Remove the top-level `layout.js` file.
  - Add a `layout.js` file inside each route group.
  - Without a top-level `layout.js`, your home `page.js` should be defined in one of the route groups, e.g., `app/(marketing)/page.js`.

- **Benefits**:

  - **Modular Code Structure**:

    - **Separation of Concerns**: Different layouts for different sections keep the codebase organized.
    - **Reusability**: Common layouts can be reused across multiple pages, reducing duplication and easing maintenance.

  - **Enhanced User Experience**:

    - **Consistency**: Shared elements like headers, footers, and sidebars provide a uniform look.
    - **Customization**: Unique layouts for different sections, e.g., admin dashboard vs. user profile page.

  - **Performance Optimization**:

    - **Efficient Loading**: Only necessary components load per page, improving performance.
    - **Code Splitting**: Next.js splits code so each layout and its components load only when needed, reducing bundle size and speeding up load times.

  - **Better Developer Experience**:

    - **Easier Debugging and Testing**: Isolated layouts make it easier to debug and test specific sections.
    - **Scalability**: Multiple layouts help manage complexity as the app grows, making it easier to add new features.

  - **Enhanced Flexibility**:

    - **Dynamic Layouts**: Create layouts that change based on routes or user roles for a personalized experience.
    - **Component Composition**: Use smaller, reusable components in layouts, making updates easier.

  - **Improved Maintainability**:
    - **Isolation of Changes**: Changes in one layout donâ€™t affect others, reducing the risk of bugs.
    - **Clear Structure**: Separate layouts help in understanding the app structure, making onboarding easier for new developers.
